# Python Challenge:PyBank and PyPoll # 

**Overview**  

This Project contain two python challenges, Pypoll and PyBank, to showcase python scripting capabilities for data analysis.  
Both task utilize csv data and required generating summary reports.  
The scripts process and anlalyze financial and election data, respectively, and output the results both to the terminal and text file.  
# PyBank    
 
Analyze a company's financial records to calculate key metrics from a dataset of monthly  
"Profit/Losses"  

**Input file**

      1. Columns: Data, profit/losses

**Task**
1. Calculate the total number of months included in the dataset.  
2. Calculate the total amount of "profit/losses" over the entire period.  
3. Calculate the changes in "proffit/losses" over the entire period and find the average  
   of those changes.    
4. Determine the greatest increase in profit (date and amont) over the entire period.
5.  Determine the greatest decrease in profit(date and amount) over the entire period.

**Output**  
  
1. Print the analysis to the terminal.  
2. Save the result in a text file at analysis/budget_analysis.txt

**Sample output**
